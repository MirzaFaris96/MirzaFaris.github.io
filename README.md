Data Analysis Portfolio
========

This contains all my projects with a variety of data analysis tools including Python (pandas, Numpy, Seaborn), SQL and R
  

*  There are one two projects that I follow along via Youtube to let me familiar with the flow of the codes while analyze data using Python and SQL which are Movies and Covid 19. 
*  I use Jupyter Notebook for data analysis with Python and R. For SQL, I'm using Google BigQuery and MySQL.
